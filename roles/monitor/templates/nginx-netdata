## enforce https
# $$ *DISABLED*: we have an internal CA, so users get cert warnings if this is turned on.
#  For child netdatas, on servers where we can control the CAs easily, it's okay to use https
#  but we can't realistically force it for users.

#        location / {
#            return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
